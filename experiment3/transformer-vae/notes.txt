Ensure the shapes of the data passed to the reconstruction loss (cross entropy) are correct.
- for example, make sure the batches are correctly expanded.

Keep an eye on the learning rate -- if only one sample is being reconstructed, it may be too high.

Use layer norms at each layer to ensure the distribution is similar among them when the parameters are updated, and not a "moving target".

Use a weighted loss to ensure the loss functions are balanced.
